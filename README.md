# Atom git-projects-manager package

Identify all your git projects and provide quick project opening.

Based on [git-projects package](https://github.com/prrrnd/atom-git-projects), it scans for `git` projects and provide a quick way to open it, but just using NodeJS core dependencies (`fs lib`).

## Installation

Just run:
```
apm install git-projects-manager
```

## Usage

Select the desired project at `Packages > Git Projects Manager` menu.

The default keybinding for refreshing projects is `ctrl-alt-p`, also accessible calling the command `Git Projects Manager: Refresh projects`.


## Settings

The `base path` where to find git projects is configurable.
